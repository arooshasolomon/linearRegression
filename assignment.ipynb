        "**Q0.** Please answer the following questions in your own words.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What makes a model \"linear\"? \"Linear\" in what?\n",
        "\n",
        "for every unit increase in x there is a positive or negative change in y, when there is enough variables it'll give you a positive or negative line. So there is a correlation between the independent and dependent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How do you interpret the coefficient for a dummy/one-hot-encoded variable? (This is a trick question, and the trick involves how you handle the intercept of the model.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Basically when encoding for a hot variable, your percentage change in y is which is the omitted categorical variable\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Can linear regression be used for classification? Explain why, or why not.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "No it cannot because the cateogrical variables are not properly defined to have any meaning persue. The linear regresson also predicts continuoous values whereas for classification the values are discrete.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What are signs that your linear model is over-fitting?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "A sign that your linear model is overfitted is when it performs very well on one data set but it doesn't in a different data set.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Clearly explain multi-colinearity using the two-stage least squares technique.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multicollinearity occurs when independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated, making it difficult to estimate their individual effects accurately. Two-stage least squares (2SLS) addresses this issue by using instrumental variables to isolate and estimate the effects of the endogenous variables, leading to more reliable coefficient estimates.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What are two ways to incorporate nonlinear relationships between your target/response/dependent/outcome variable $y$ and your features/control/response/independent variables $x$?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polynomial regression would be one example where you have multiple variables correlated allowing you to see more complexity\n",
        "\n",
        "Splines or Piecewise Functions: Splines, such as B-splines or natural splines, divide the range of the independent variable into segments and fit separate polynomial functions to each segment, allowing for flexibility in modeling nonlinear relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the interpretation of the intercept? A slope coefficient for a variable? The coefficient for a dummy/one-hot-encoded variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "the slope efficent is basically saying how much the x variable is expted to increase with y. And the coefficent of the hot endcoded variable, is when there is a difference of however amount between the different cateogrical groups."

Compare the coefficients in the regression to the table from part 1. What pattern do you see? What are the coefficients in a regression of a continuous variable on one categorical variable?\n",

Split the sample 80/20 into a training and a test set and run a regression including that kind of \"property type X neighborhood\" dummy, plus `Review Scores Rating`. How does the slope coefficient for `Review Scores Rating`, the $R^2$, and the RMSE change? Do they increase significantly compares to part 5? Are the coefficients in this regression just the sum of the coefficients for `Neighbourhood ` and `Property Type` from 5? What is the most expensive kind of property you can rent?"

This is the first step we would take in investigating whether a system is fair, or how large the disparities are: Does it treat people with similar observable characteristics similarly, or not? We are going to look at a common question: Are Black defendants treated differently from white or Asian ones?
